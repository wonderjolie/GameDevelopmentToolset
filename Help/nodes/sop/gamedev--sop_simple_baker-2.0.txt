""" SOP Based Baking of Texture Maps """

This node will Bake Geometry and Material information from a High Resolution mesh to a Low Resolution Mesh. 

It is a helper wrapper around the [Games Baker ROP|Node:out/gamedev--rop_games_baker-2.0] and [Bake Texture ROP|Node:out/baketexture] in order to simplify the interface. 

One main feature that the ROP version has is that you can bake several mesh pairs in the same bake. You can do this by adding more High Low Pairs on the Meshes MultiParm

WARNING: 
    The preferred node to use for baking is the [Maps Baker SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_maps_baker]


@inputs

Target Geometry (LOW):
    Geometry onto which the textures will be applied and baked into 

Source Geometry (HIGH):
    High Res Source Geometry that will baked onto the low res



@parameters

    Resolution:
        Size of the output textures
    Base Path:
        Path for the output textures. $(CHANNEL) is necessary here and will be replaced with the type of texture (basecolor, normal, etc)
    Export FBX:
        Optionally also export the incoming model as an FBX file to this path
    == Channels ==
    Vertex Color:
        Enable baking Vertex Colors (and Diffuse Textures) and specify the suffix
    Normal Map:
        Enable baking Tangent Space normal maps  and specify the suffix
    Opacity Map:
        Enable baking an Opacity/Transparency/Alpha map  and specify the suffix
    Roughness Map:
        Enable baking Roughness that is sampled from the source's material and specify the suffix
    Metallic Map:
        Enable baking Metallic that is sampled from the source's material and specify the suffix
    World Normal Map:
        Enable baking World Space normal maps  and specify the suffix
    Ambient Occlusion:
        Enable baking Ambient Occlusion maps and specify the suffix
    Curvature:
        Enable baking Curvature (Substance Style) and specify the suffix
    Thickness:
        Enable baking Thickness maps  and specify the suffix
    Position:
        Enable baking Position maps  and specify the suffix
    Height:
        Enable baking Height/Displacement maps  and specify the suffix
    Custom Channels:
        Number of Custom Maps to be baked 
    Attribute Name:
        Point Attribute to be baked 
    Suffix:
        `CHANNEL` value for the texture name    

    == Advanced ==         
    Valid Frame Range:
        Determines if a single frame should be baked or several frames. (Useful for baking oceans and other animated effects) 
        
        NOTE:
            If baking a frame range, make sure to remember to add a $F to your filenames, otherwise it will overwrite the same textures every frame. 
       
    Start/End/Inc:
        Start and End Frame, and what steps to skip 
        
Use MikkT Tangent Space:
        Use the MikkT calculations to bake out the Tangent Normal Maps.
        
        NOTE:
            The Viewport shader doesn't have MikkT capabilities, so you might see some bruising that won't occur on a game engine. 
            You can use the GameDev PBR Shader in combination with the PolyFrame node if you would like to view the correct MikkT values. We understand this isn't optimal. 
        
    Output basecolor in Linear Space:
        Gamma correct the BaseColor maps
        
    Tangent Normal Flip Y:
        Invert the Green Channel in the Normal Map. 
    Disable Lighting/Emission:
        Ignore any lighting information. Disabling this will allow you to bake light information into your objects (just make them white) 
        
    Cage Mesh:
        Optional cage mesh. Must have the same topology and UVs as the UV Object. Typically a dupicate of UV Object whose vertices are slightly pushed outward. Used to determine the projection direction.
    Border Padding:
        Additional pixels at the border of each UV island 
    Baking Samples:
        Number of Samples used for raytraced shading
    Ray Bias:
        Determine how much to offset the rays from the surface of the object along the normal vector. 
    Ray Distance:
        Maximum Distance to trace for nearby surfaces. -1 means infinite distance.

        
    == Material ==      
    Base Color:
        Basic Tint on the Albedo
    IOR:
        Index of Refraction, similar to the base PBR value of 0.04. High Values refract more light
    Roughness:
        How rough or smooth is the specular highlight
    Diffuse Map:
        Which channel to display as the preview map
