""" Example HDA from the Rebirth Project to generate Sci Fi Panneling """

This is a tool that was designed specifically for our GDC Demo with Quixel, but there was enough interest on how it was done that we decided to release it as is for reverse engineering purposes. 

It makes heavy usage of the [Lot Subdivision SOP|Node:sop/gamedev--sop_lot_subdivision] with some extra beveling and notching added for flavor.

@parameters 
    == Global Settings ==
    Generate New UVs:
        Overrides incoming UVs with a Flatten
    Pattern Rotation:
        Angle of the cutting pattern
    Border Thickness:
        Padding around the panels (Part of the Sci Fi Look)
    Global Seed:
        Randomization Control
    Thickness:
        Depth of the notch cut
    Panel Deletion Chance:
        Percentage (0-100) of chance that a panel will be deleted. 100 means all panels will be gone, 0 means no panel will be deleted
    Deletion Seed:
        Randomization control of the deletion for fine tuning
    Enable Random Vertex Colors:
        Add Vertex Colors to Panels
    Vertex Colors:
        Distribution of the color ratio
    == Lot Division ==
    Irregularity:
        Smaller values mean the cuts will be halfway along a primitive, higher values will yield primitives of different sizes. 
    Minimum Lot Size:
        Primitives smaller than this size will no longer be considered for cutting
    Vertical Bias:
        Negative numbers will generate horizontal slivers, Positive numbers will generate vertical slivers
    Alignment:
        Method of orientating the cuts. Bounding box is for worldspace cutting, longest edge is relative to the shape. 
    Cluster Lots:
        Enables joining of lots into clusters
    Number of Clusters:
        Final Number of Lots after merging them into clusters
    Vertical Packing:
        Strength on a Gradient that clumps lots together towards the top (or bottom)
    == Padding ==
    Spacing:
        Padding in between panels
    Spacing Variation:
        Randomization of the padding between panels
    == Notches ==
    Percentage:
        Chance for an edge to be booleaned by a sci fi notch shape
    Deviation:
        Slide the notch along the edge (from the center)
    Length:
        Length of the notch
    Notches Seed:
        Randomness for Notch 
    == Corner Bevels ==
    Corner Bevels Chance:
        Chance to lop off a corner (0-100)
    Corner Bevels Depth:
        Depth of the Corner Cut
