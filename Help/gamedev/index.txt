"""The Game Development Toolset is a collection of high level tools aimed to speed up games related workflows in Houdini. There are over 90 tools that range from UVing to generating Motion Vectors from simulations. These tools are not tied to the regular Houdini development cycle and become available the moment they are ready for testing. They are currently deployed through our github page, and will soon be updatable from within Houdini. """

== Downloading the Tools ==

As of 16.5 you can download the tools straight from Houdini. 
Under the Games Development Shelf (you might need to add this to your shelf sets) click on the Update Toolset button. 
This will pop up a dialog prompting you with which release to download from, recently we have started daily builds, so you can choose whether to download a daily build or a production build. 
It is recommended to always grab the daily build for the very latest tools.
You can also clone the tools directly from our Github repository, more details below
